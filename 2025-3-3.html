    <h2>President Murmu Visits Dholavira</h2>
    <p>
        The President of India visited the UNESCO World Heritage Site Dholavira in Gujarat. Dholavira was a significant trading hub for copper, shells, semi-precious stones, and timber, with trade routes linking to Mesopotamia (Iraq), Magan (Oman), and other Indus Valley Civilization cities. The decline of Dholavira is attributed to climate change leading to aridity, drying up of the Saraswati River, trade disruptions due to the collapse of the Mesopotamian Civilization, and desertification turning the navigable Rann of Kutch into a mudflat. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

    <h2>Article 136 of the Constitution</h2>
    <p>
        Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, speaking at a conference on arbitration, highlighted concerns regarding the misuse of Article 136 of the Constitution. Article 136 allows the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, or order made by any court or tribunal in India, serving as a discretionary power for the court to entertain appeals even in cases where no other legal provision provides an automatic right of appeal. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    <h2>Sources and Health Effects of PM2.5</h2>
    <p>
        A study published in the journal Nature Communications investigated the sources and health impacts of PM2.5 in Northern India, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. In Delhi, PM2.5 is dominated by ammonium chloride and organic aerosols from vehicular emissions, residential heating, and fossil fuel oxidation. Outside Delhi, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and biomass-burning derived organic aerosols are more prominent. The oxidative potential of PM2.5 in Indian cities is among the highest globally, exceeding levels in Chinese and European cities by up to five times, primarily due to organic aerosols from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

    <h2>Blue Ghost Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lunar lander successfully touched down on the Moon's Mare Crisium region. Developed as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, the mission aims to enhance understanding of the lunar environment. The lander carries 10 NASA payloads, including instruments for collecting lunar soil samples and measuring subsurface temperatures. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

    <h2>Rushikulya River and Olive Ridley Turtles</h2>
    <p>
        Forest officials restricted entry along a 5-km stretch from Gokharakuda to Bateswar near the Rushikulya river mouth in Ganjam district to protect Olive Ridley turtle eggs. The Rushikulya River, flowing entirely within Odisha, is famous for being one of the largest nesting sites for Olive Ridley sea turtles. Each year, between January and March, thousands of these turtles come to the shores to lay their eggs, creating a spectacular natural event known as Arribada. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

    <h2>Juanga Tribe</h2>
    <p>
        The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) sought an action taken report from the district magistrate-cum-collector of Keonjhar on alleged human rights violations of the Juanga tribe, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in the district. The Juang are primarily concentrated in Odisha and are known for their clan structure and kinship organizations. Historically reliant on hunting, gathering, and limited cultivation, they have adapted to changes by showcasing expertise in basket-weaving. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

    <h2>Neonatal Sepsis</h2>
    <p>
        A study published in The Lancet Global Health journal indicated that more than a third of newborns diagnosed with sepsis could die. Neonatal sepsis, a blood infection occurring in infants younger than 90 days old, can be caused by bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Listeria, and some strains of streptococcus. Symptoms include body temperature changes, breathing problems, and diarrhea. While sepsis in newborns is curable, it must be treated in a hospital, usually through intravenous antibiotics. Globally, neonatal sepsis results in more than 550,000 deaths annually, with India accoun
